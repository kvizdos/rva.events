## WHY GO

REST is all about endpoints that perform specific queries or operations. This works fine, but the client is limited by which queries have been exposed. What if the back-end exposed the data, but the client could decide which subset of data it needed, or how to interact with that data? That’s the promise of GraphQL — simplify the back-end, give the client more power, and make it easier to evolve APIs. In this talk, we’ll explain what GraphQL is, how it works, and look at a JavaScript client and a Java back-end.
