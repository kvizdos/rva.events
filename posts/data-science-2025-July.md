## WHY GO

The way we deal with missing data is often not given enough thought. In fact, missing data has a lot to teach us. Missing data is a form of information itself, and thinking about it can help sharpen our focus on our end users, bias, and how we think about data.

We'll discuss what missing data is, the many mechanics of missing data, and the differences between simple to complex options for dealing with it.
