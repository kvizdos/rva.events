## WHY GO

Single Statement, Many Changes: How One Statement Can Modify Multiple Tables

You can only insert into, update, or delete from one table at a time. At least that’s what we’re told when we first learn to write SQL statements. However, the truth is that one data change could affect many other tables.

In this session, we will example how one data modification statement can affect numerous tables. We'll break these down into two different approaches: implicit & explicit. We will explore syntax, performance gains, and gotchas of these different methodologies.

Our goal is to not only understand how to implement these different techniques but ask why (and where) we may want to use them.
