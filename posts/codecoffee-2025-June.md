## WHY GO

RVA Code and Coffee is an inclusive, informal co-working session. People of all skill levels attend, and we love it that way.

Here is the format of our event:

## SCHEDULE

**9:30 AM:** Arrive, grab a cup of coffee, and see old friends or meet some new people

**9:50 AM:** Our Introduction circle begins. Each person says their name, what they're working on, what they can help others with, and what they would like help with.

**10:10 AM - 12:00 PM:** The remainder of the event is self-organized. It is completely up to you. You can sit down and code, you can go and ask for help from someone else, or you can seek out someone else that you may be able to help. It's all about collaboration and networking.
