## WHY GO

As a former engineer at AWS, Ford Prior dangles his feet off the cutting edge of the Generative AI application space. By a rare turn of events, he's is going to spill the tea on what's going on behind the scenes at AWS. Specifically, what tools they're using to deliver value in the field, what trends he's seeing in the AI maker-space, and whatever else he feels called to share! Join us at Ippon Technology HQ in Richmond for beer and BBQ sponsored by Flying Pig Labs, VA (or virtually via Zoom - this is a Hybrid event).
