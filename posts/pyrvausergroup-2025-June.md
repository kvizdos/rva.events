## WHY GO

Kedro is a Python framework for building data science pipelines that follow software engineering best practices, even if the author doesn't have a software engineering background.


Originally created and proved out by a consulting firm to allow dropping quickly into different types of projects, Kedro is now open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation.


Whether for performing data extraction, data transformation, model training, or other tasks, Kedro is useful for junior colleagues as well as senior contributors precisely because it offers a light-touch opinionated approach that both can seamlessly use.


Join us as we will talk through Kedro's approach to building pipelines, and will explore ways in which Kedro can be useful across a variety of data-science-related tasks.

All events are open to all skill levels. If you're just starting out, come to learn and feel free to ask questions. That's where the real learning happens. If you're a more seasoned developer, we'd love to learn from you. Despite what the Zen of Python says, there are usually more than one way to do something, so share your knowledge!
