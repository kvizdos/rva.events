## WHY GO

Come show off a project, socialize, or just hang out. No need for a reservation. Thinking about becoming a member? Come on in, and tour the space. All are welcome! Thursday night has always been our social night when members hang out together. There is no program, agenda, or activity for open house. We just hang out and we invite you to come and visit with us, get a tour if you like.

Open Houses are the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month. Arrive anytime between 7pm and 9pm.
