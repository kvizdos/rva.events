Title: Validating Java with Policy as Code (PaC)
Date: 06/24/2025
Time: 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM EDT
Summary: "This talk will introduce Policy as Code (PaC), and how it is used to validate Java code and Java project artifacts. Jimmy will discuss solutions used to parse Java project artifacts (including code), and then use PaC solutions to validate the artifacts. Using PaC with Java projects extends the reach of automated Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) for Java projects, beyond the out-of-the-box features of your typical Open Source Software (OSS) and Commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions."

Jimmy Ray has been writing and speaking for over 25 years. For the past several years he has focused on providing security, compliance, and governance solutions with Policy as Code (PaC) in the areas of cloud computing, containerization, and software supply chain. Jimmy is recognized as a subject matter expert in PaC and software supply chain security.

This talk will introduce PaC, and how it is used to validate Java code and Java project artifacts. Jimmy will discuss solutions used to parse Java project artifacts (including code), and then use PaC solutions to validate the artifacts. Using PaC with Java projects extends the reach of automated Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) for Java projects, beyond the out-of-the-box features of your typical Open Source Software (OSS) and Commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions.
