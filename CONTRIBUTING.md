## Our Stance on AI-related Events

RVA.Events is for everyone, but we can't ignore how AI is actively displacing the people who make Richmond vibrant. Artists, musicians, and writers ([heck, even developers!](https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/costar-layoffs-richmond-feb-28-2025#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20CoStar%20Group%2C%20Inc.,one%20reason%20for%20the%20layoffs.)) are being pushed out as companies chase automation over community.

We believe in centering what's human, local, and creative. Most AI-related events will be respectfully declined, especially those rehashing common narratives. If your event offers something truly new and community-grounded, we'll give it a fair look. But we won't help amplify what's erasing real people's work.

## Event Guidelines

Please keep events focused on the mission: they should be cool, relevant, useful, or simply too small to show up on the big platforms.

Each event is created via a Markdown file in the `posts` directory. Check out any post for a good example of what it should look like, but this goes into more specifics.

### Header Metadata

- **Title**: Keep it short n' sweet. If "RVA" or "richmond" is not used as "branding", please drop it. E.g "ScrumRVA", "HackRVA", "RVASEC", etc is okay, but "RVA Hiking Club" is not preferred.
- **Date**: `MM/DD/YYYY` format. If an event spans multiple days, use `MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY`.
- **Time**: HH:MM AM/PM to HH:MM AM/PM
- **Summary**: This is what is shown during the "discovery" process. Make it nice, but please don't buzzword-fill or be "spammy".
- **Author**: This needs to correlate with an `author/AUTHOR.md` file.
- **Group**: The group name associated with the Author.
- **Tags**: Recommended: Tech, Arts, Music, Business. Add more if you'd like! They aren't used a bunch right now.
- **Price**: **Price is always FREE, unless it is a conference. This is not the place to advertise paid events.**
- **Location**: Please include the venue name. If there are multiple around town, include a specifier like "(Short Pump)".
- **RSVP**: This should be the link to the event's RSVP page. It can be hosted wherever it is convenient. (pro tip: if you use Meetup, add `?action=rsvp` to the end of the url!)

### Event Body

Each event needs at least:

- **WHY GO**: Tell the person what they will get out of this experience.
- **WHEN TO GO**: E.g. ```Monday, June 23, 2025 \n\n 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM```
- **WHERE TO GO**: E.g. ```Ippon Technologies \n\n 3431 W Leigh St, Richmond, VA```
